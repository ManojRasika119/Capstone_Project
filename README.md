HOW TO ESTABLISH A HIGHLY SECURE HIGH AVAILABLE AND RELIABLE NETWORK ENVIRONMENT.
ABSTRACT
This research paper presents how to establish a network with high availability, reliable and highly secure network environment. Main objectives of this network design are,
a.	A reliable network to interconnect branch offices and headquarters.
b.	Remote access to network for employees.
c.	Implementing a large data center.
d.	Implementing a disaster recovery plan. 
e.	Implementing a maintenance plan.
f.	IP PBX to communicate among branches. 
g.	Video conferencing capabilities among regional branches. 

The network setup; main server in the office headquarters with disaster recovery plant, web server in the branch office, located in a different country. And two data centers in each location for high availability purpose. 
INTRODUCTION
The rise in organized crime use of the Internet, cyber espionage, growing data theft, and the increasing sophistication of network attacks are all examples of the real threats faced by organizations these days. According to the past experience most of the attackers looking for the vulnerabilities of the network because attack should be conducted through the network in most of the cases. So implementing highly secure network is most essential to any organization. As a key enabler of the business activity, networks need to be designed with security in mind, and to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of applications, endpoints and the network itself. These days many threats are coming from both outside and inside effects. So it is highly recommended to secure the environment from both of those threats. The Internet edge design incorporates security as an important component of the network architecture, where a rich set of security technologies and capabilities are deployed in a layered approach, but under a common strategy. 
In this proposed design, it is clearly describe the secure design strategies of the network which are located in two different places. Disaster Recovery (DR) plan is also proposed here. So that it will highly concern about the security of the network. Not only that, it will concerned on high availability as well. In this example an office environment consists with a DR site. There are some facilities on the network which are described above. Also it is concerned about forensic friendly environment for investigation the log reports of incidents. Also maintains plan such as auditing and log report reviewing etc.  Intrusion detection and prevention capabilities are also described broadly in this design.
NETWORK DESIGN
As mentioned office headquarters having a main server and DR site located in one country and branch office is located in another. Then three locations were identified in the network. They are;
a.	Headquarters site.
b.	Branch site.
c.	Disaster recovery site.
According to the scenario, following are facilities and requirements that organization have;
a.	IP PBX to communicate among the branches.
b.	Video conferencing among the regional branches.
c.	Remote access to the network for employees.
d.	Reliable network connection to interconnect headquarters and branches.
e.	Normal office desktop access to the employees.
Following are the factors considered during the network design;
a.	Fulfill all the above mentioned facilities and requirements.
b.	High security of the network.
c.	Reliability of the network.
d.	High availability of the network.
e.	Disaster recovery plan.
f.	Forensic friendly environment.
g.	Service level standers.
h.	Economic considerations (will not be highly considered).
i.	Maintains plan.
Security is mainly considered during the design of the network, but when we consider the design phase we should consider about confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of the system. These three factors should be balanced in any system. Otherwise there will be huge problems arise from both customer side and employee side. As mentioned above high availability for both ends are highly concerned. Disaster recovery plan should be realistic and executable at any time. Also if any incident happened there should be a capability of the investigation what had happened, how it happened and what cause it to be happened? That is forensic friendly environment. Also there should be a regular audit on network related equipment (both software and hardware) in security concern. Finally, economic factors should be considered but it should not be harmful to the security of the network.
